        "\n# Noise estimation using PIESNO\n\nOften, one is interested in estimating the noise in the diffusion signal. One\nof the methods to do this is the Probabilistic Identification and Estimation of\nNoise (PIESNO) framework :footcite:p:`Koay2009b`. Using this method, one can\ndetect the standard deviation of the noise from Diffusion-Weighted Imaging\n(DWI). PIESNO also works with multiple channel DWI datasets that are acquired\nfrom N array coils for both SENSE and GRAPPA reconstructions.\n\nThe PIESNO method works in two steps:\n\n1) First, it finds voxels that are most likely background voxels. Intuitively,\nthese voxels have very similar diffusion-weighted intensities (up to some\nnoise) in the fourth dimension of the DWI dataset. White matter, gray matter\nor CSF voxels have diffusion intensities that vary quite a lot across different\ndirections.\n\n2) From these estimated background voxels and the input number of coils $N$,\nPIESNO finds what sigma each Gaussian from each of the $N$ coils would have\ngenerated the observed Rician ($N = 1$) or non-central Chi ($N > 1$)\ndistributed noise profile in the DWI datasets.\n\nPIESNO makes an important assumption: the Gaussian noise standard deviation is\nassumed to be uniform. The noise is uniform across multiple slice locations or\nacross multiple images of the same location.\n\nFor the full details, please refer to the original paper.\n\nIn this example, we will demonstrate the use of PIESNO with a 3-shell data-set.\n\nWe start by importing necessary modules and functions:\n"

        "Now that we have fetched a dataset, we must call PIESNO with the right number\nof coils used to acquire this dataset. It is also important to know what\nwas the parallel reconstruction algorithm used. Here, the data comes from a\nGRAPPA reconstruction, was acquired with a 12-elements head coil available on\nthe Tim Trio Siemens, for which the 12 coil elements are combined into 4\ngroups of 3 coil elements each. The signal is therefore received through 4\ndistinct groups of receiver channels, yielding N = 4. Had we used a GE\nacquisition, we would have used N=1 even if multiple channel coils are used\nbecause GE uses a SENSE reconstruction, which has a Rician noise nature and\nthus N is always 1.\n\n"
