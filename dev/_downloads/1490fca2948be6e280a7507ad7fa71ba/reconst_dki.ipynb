        "\n# Reconstruction of the diffusion signal with the kurtosis tensor model\n\nThe diffusion kurtosis model is an expansion of the diffusion tensor model\n(see `sphx_glr_examples_built_reconstruction_reconst_dti.py`). In\naddition to the diffusion tensor (DT), the diffusion kurtosis model\nquantifies the degree to which water diffusion in biological tissues is\nnon-Gaussian using the kurtosis tensor (KT) [Jensen2005]_.\n\nMeasurements of non-Gaussian diffusion from the diffusion kurtosis model are of\ninterest because they can be used to characterize tissue microstructural\nheterogeneity [Jensen2010]_. Moreover, DKI can be used to: 1) derive concrete\nbiophysical parameters, such as the density of axonal fibers and diffusion\ntortuosity [Fierem2011]_ (see\n`sphx_glr_examples_built_reconstruction_reconst_dki_micro.py`); and 2)\nresolve crossing fibers in tractography and to obtain invariant rotational\nmeasures not limited to well-aligned fiber populations [NetoHe2015]_.\n\nThe diffusion kurtosis model expresses the diffusion-weighted signal as:\n\n\\begin{align}S(n,b)=S_{0}e^{-bD(n)+\\frac{1}{6}b^{2}D(n)^{2}K(n)}\\end{align}\n\nwhere $\\mathbf{b}$ is the applied diffusion weighting (which is dependent on\nthe measurement parameters), $S_0$ is the signal in the absence of diffusion\ngradient sensitization, $\\mathbf{D(n)}$ is the value of diffusion along\ndirection $\\mathbf{n}$, and $\\mathbf{K(n)}$ is the value of kurtosis along\ndirection $\\mathbf{n}$. The directional diffusion $\\mathbf{D(n)}$ and kurtosis\n$\\mathbf{K(n)}$ can be related to the diffusion tensor (DT) and kurtosis tensor\n(KT) using the following equations:\n\n\\begin{align}D(n)=\\sum_{i=1}^{3}\\sum_{j=1}^{3}n_{i}n_{j}D_{ij}\\end{align}\n\nand\n\n\\begin{align}K(n)=\\frac{MD^{2}}{D(n)^{2}}\\sum_{i=1}^{3}\\sum_{j=1}^{3}\\sum_{k=1}^{3}\n     \\sum_{l=1}^{3}n_{i}n_{j}n_{k}n_{l}W_{ijkl}\\end{align}\n\nwhere $D_{ij}$ are the elements of the second-order DT, and $W_{ijkl}$ the\nelements of the fourth-order KT and $MD$ is the mean diffusivity. As the DT,\nKT has antipodal symmetry and thus only 15 Wijkl elements are needed to fully\ncharacterize the KT:\n\n\\begin{align}\\begin{matrix} ( & W_{xxxx} & W_{yyyy} & W_{zzzz} & W_{xxxy} & W_{xxxz}\n                    & ... \\\\\n                    & W_{xyyy} & W_{yyyz} & W_{xzzz} & W_{yzzz} & W_{xxyy}\n                    & ... \\\\\n                    & W_{xxzz} & W_{yyzz} & W_{xxyz} & W_{xyyz} & W_{xyzz}\n                    & & )\\end{matrix}\\end{align}\n\nIn the following example we show how to fit the diffusion kurtosis model on\ndiffusion-weighted multi-shell datasets and how to estimate diffusion kurtosis\nbased statistics.\n\nFirst, we import all relevant modules:\n"

MK is, therefore,\nhigher in white matter since it is highly compartmentalized by myelin\nsheaths. These water diffusion compartmentalization is expected to be more\npronounced perpendicularly to white matter fibers and thus the RK map\npresents higher amplitudes than the AK map.\n\nIt is important to note that kurtosis estimates might present negative\nestimates in deep white matter regions (e.g. the band of dark voxels in the\nRK map above). These negative kurtosis values are artefactual and might be\ninduced by:\n1) low radial diffusivities of aligned white matter - since it is very hard\nto capture non-Gaussian information in radial direction due to it's low\ndiffusion decays, radial kurtosis estimates (and consequently the mean\nkurtosis estimates) might have low robustness and tendency to exhibit\nnegative values [NetoHe2012]_;\n2) Gibbs artefacts - MRI images might be corrupted by signal oscillation\nartefact between tissue's edges if an inadequate number of high frequencies\nof the k-space is sampled. These oscillations might have different signs on\nimages acquired with different diffusion-weighted and inducing negative\nbiases in kurtosis parametric maps [Perron2015]_, [NetoHe2018]_.\n\nOne can try to suppress this issue by using the more advance noise and\nartefact suppression algorithms, e.g., as mentioned above, the MP-PCA\ndenoising (`sphx_glr_examples_built_preprocessing_denoise_mppca.py`)\nand Gibbs Unringing\n(`sphx_glr_examples_built_preprocessing_denoise_gibbs.py`)\nalgorithms. Alternatively, one can overcome this artefact by computing the\nkurtosis values from powder-averaged diffusion-weighted signals. The details\non how to compute the kurtosis from powder-average signals in dipy are\ndescribed in follow the tutorial\n(`sphx_glr_examples_built_reconstruction_reconst_msdki.py`). Finally,\none can use constrained optimization to ensure that the fitted parameters\nare physically plausible [DelaHa2020]_, as we will illustrate in the next\nsection. Ideally though, artefacts such as Gibbs ringing should be corrected\nfor as well as possible before using constrained optimization.\n\n## Constrained optimization for DKI\n\nWhen instantiating the DiffusionKurtosisModel, the model can be set up to use\nconstraints with the option `fit_method='CLS'` (for ordinary least squares)\nor with `fit_method='CWLS'` (for weighted least squares). Constrained fitting\ntakes more time than unconstrained fitting, but is generally recommended to\nprevent physically unplausible parameter estimates [DelaHa2020]_. For\nperformance purposes it is recommended to use the MOSEK solver\n(https://www.mosek.com/) by setting ``cvxpy_solver='MOSEK'``. Different\nsolvers can differ greatly in terms of runtime and solution accuracy, and in\nsome cases solvers may show warnings about convergence or recommended option\nsettings.\n\n<div class=\"alert alert-info\"><h4>Note</h4><p>In certain atypical scenarios, the DKI+ constraints could potentially be\n   too restrictive. Always check the results of a constrained fit with their\n   unconstrained counterpart to verify that there are no unexpected\n   qualitative differences.</p></div>\n\n"
