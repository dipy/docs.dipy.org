Synopsis
--------

Workflow for Local Fiber Tracking.

This workflow use a saved peaks and metrics (PAM) file as input.  See :footcite:p:`Garyfallidis2012b` and :footcite:p:`Amirbekian2016` for further details about the method.

Usage
-----

.. code-block:: bash

    dipy_track [OPTIONS] pam_files stopping_files seeding_files

Input Parameters
----------------

* ``pam_files``

  Path to the peaks and metrics files. This path may contain
   wildcards to use multiple masks at once.

* ``stopping_files``

  Path to images (e.g. FA) used for stopping criterion for tracking.

* ``seeding_files``

  A binary image showing where we need to seed for tracking.

General Options
---------------

* ``--use_binary_mask``

  If True, uses a binary stopping criterion. If the provided
  `stopping_files` are not binary, `stopping_thr` will be used to
  binarize the images.

* ``--stopping_thr``

  Threshold applied to stopping volume's data to identify where
  tracking has to stop.

* ``--seed_density``

  Number of seeds per dimension inside voxel.
   For example, seed_density of 2 means 8 regularly distributed
   points in the voxel. And seed density of 1 means 1 point at the
   center of the voxel.

* ``--step_size``

  Step size (in mm) used for tracking.

* ``--tracking_method``

  Select direction getter strategy :
   - "eudx" (Uses the peaks saved in the pam_files)
   - "deterministic" or "det" for a deterministic tracking
     (Uses the sh saved in the pam_files, default)
   - "probabilistic" or "prob" for a Probabilistic tracking
     (Uses the sh saved in the pam_files)
   - "closestpeaks" or "cp" for a ClosestPeaks tracking
     (Uses the sh saved in the pam_files)

* ``--pmf_threshold``

  Threshold for ODF functions.

* ``--max_angle``

  Maximum angle between streamline segments (range [0, 90]).

* ``--save_seeds``

  If true, save the seeds associated to their streamline
  in the 'data_per_streamline' Tractogram dictionary using
  'seeds' as the key.

Output Options
--------------

* ``--out_dir``

  Output directory. (default current directory)

* ``--out_tractogram``

  Name of the tractogram file to be saved.
