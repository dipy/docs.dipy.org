Synopsis
--------

BundleWarp: streamline-based nonlinear registration.

BundleWarp :footcite:p:`Chandio2023` is a nonrigid registration method for deformable registration of white matter tracts.

Usage
-----

.. code-block:: bash

    dipy_bundlewarp [OPTIONS] static_file moving_file

Input Parameters
----------------

* ``static_file``

  Path to the static (reference) .trk file.

* ``moving_file``

  Path to the moving (target to be registered) .trk file.

General Options
---------------

* ``--dist``

  Path to the precalculated distance matrix file.

* ``--alpha``

  Represents the trade-off between regularizing the deformation and
  having points match very closely. Lower value of alpha means high
  deformations. It is represented with Î» in BundleWarp paper. NOTE:
  setting alpha<=0.01 will result in highly deformable registration
  that could extremely modify the original anatomy of the moving
  bundle.

* ``--beta``

  Represents the strength of the interaction between points
  Gaussian kernel size.

* ``--max_iter``

  Maximum number of iterations for deformation process in ml-CPD
  method.

* ``--affine``

  If False, use rigid registration as starting point. (default True)

Output Options
--------------

* ``--out_dir``

  Output directory. (default current directory)

* ``--out_linear_moved``

  Filename of linearly moved bundle.

* ``--out_nonlinear_moved``

  Filename of nonlinearly moved (warped) bundle.

* ``--out_warp_transform``

  Filename of warp transformations generated by BundleWarp.

* ``--out_warp_kernel``

  Filename of regularization gaussian kernel generated by BundleWarp.

* ``--out_dist``

  Filename of MDF distance matrix.

* ``--out_matched_pairs``

  Filename of matched pairs; streamline correspondences between two
  bundles.
