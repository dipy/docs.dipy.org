Synopsis
--------

Workflow for fitting the MAPMRI model (with optional Laplacian regularization). Generates rtop, lapnorm, msd, qiv, rtap, rtpp, non-gaussian (ng), parallel ng, perpendicular ng saved in a nifti format in input files provided by `data_files` and saves the nifti files to an output directory specified by `out_dir`.

In order for the MAPMRI workflow to work in the way intended either the Laplacian or positivity or both must be set to True.

Usage
-----

.. code-block:: bash

    dipy_fit_mapmri [OPTIONS] data_files bvals_files bvecs_files small_delta big_delta

Input Parameters
----------------

* ``data_files``

  Path to the input volume.

* ``bvals_files``

  Path to the bval files.

* ``bvecs_files``

  Path to the bvec files.

* ``small_delta``

  Small delta value used in generation of gradient table of provided
  bval and bvec.

* ``big_delta``

  Big delta value used in generation of gradient table of provided
  bval and bvec.

General Options
---------------

* ``--b0_threshold``

  Threshold used to find b0 volumes.

* ``--laplacian``

  Regularize using the Laplacian of the MAP-MRI basis.

* ``--positivity``

  Constrain the propagator to be positive.

* ``--bval_threshold``

  Sets the b-value threshold to be used in the scale factor
  estimation. In order for the estimated non-Gaussianity to have
  meaning this value should set to a lower value (b<2000 s/mm^2)
  such that the scale factors are estimated on signal points that
  reasonably represent the spins at Gaussian diffusion.

* ``--save_metrics``

  List of metrics to save.
  Possible values: rtop, laplacian_signal, msd, qiv, rtap, rtpp,
  ng, perng, parng

* ``--laplacian_weighting``

  Weighting value used in fitting the MAPMRI model in the Laplacian
  and both model types.

* ``--radial_order``

  Even value used to set the order of the basis.

* ``--sphere_name``

  Sphere name on which to reconstruct the fODFs.

* ``--relative_peak_threshold``

  Only return peaks greater than ``relative_peak_threshold * m``
  where m is the largest peak.

* ``--min_separation_angle``

  The minimum distance between directions. If two peaks are too close
  only the larger of the two is returned.

* ``--npeaks``

  Maximum number of peaks found.

* ``--normalize_peaks``

  If true, all peak values are calculated relative to `max(odf)`.

* ``--extract_pam_values``

  Save or not to save pam volumes as single nifti files.

Output Options
--------------

* ``--out_dir``

  Output directory. (default: current directory)

* ``--out_rtop``

  Name of the rtop to be saved.

* ``--out_lapnorm``

  Name of the norm of Laplacian signal to be saved.

* ``--out_msd``

  Name of the msd to be saved.

* ``--out_qiv``

  Name of the qiv to be saved.

* ``--out_rtap``

  Name of the rtap to be saved.

* ``--out_rtpp``

  Name of the rtpp to be saved.

* ``--out_ng``

  Name of the Non-Gaussianity to be saved.

* ``--out_perng``

  Name of the Non-Gaussianity perpendicular to be saved.

* ``--out_parng``

  Name of the Non-Gaussianity parallel to be saved.

* ``--out_pam``

  Name of the peaks volume to be saved.

* ``--out_peaks_dir``

  Name of the peaks directions volume to be saved.

* ``--out_peaks_values``

  Name of the peaks values volume to be saved.

* ``--out_peaks_indices``

  Name of the peaks indices volume to be saved.
