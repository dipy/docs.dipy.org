    <div class="sphx-glr-thumbcontainer" tooltip="This demo presents an example of crossing-preserving contextual enhancement of FOD/ODF fields :footciteMeesters2016a, implementing the contextual PDE framework of :footcitePortegies2015b for processing HARDI data. The aim is to enhance the alignment of elongated structures in the data such that crossing/junctions are maintained while reducing noise and small incoherent structures. This is achieved via a hypo-elliptic 2nd order PDE in the domain of coupled positions and orientations \mathbb{R}^3 \rtimes S^2. This domain carries a non-flat geometrical differential structure that allows including a notion of alignment between neighboring points.">

    <div class="sphx-glr-thumbcontainer" tooltip="This demo presents the fiber to bundle coherence (FBC) quantitative measure of the alignment of each fiber with the surrounding fiber bundles :footciteMeesters2016b. These measures are useful in &#x27;cleaning&#x27; the results of tractography algorithms, since low FBCs indicate which fibers are isolated and poorly aligned with their neighbors, as shown in the figure below.">
