    dipy_align_syn [OPTIONS] static_image_files moving_image_files

Input Parameters
----------------

* ``static_image_files``

  Path of the static image file.
  

* ``moving_image_files``

  Path to the moving image file.
  

General Options
---------------

* ``--prealign_file``

  The text file containing pre alignment information via an
   affine matrix.
  

* ``--inv_static``

  Apply the inverse mapping to the static image.
  

* ``--level_iters``

  The number of iterations at each level of the gaussian pyramid.
  

* ``--metric``

  The metric to be used.
  metric available: cc (Cross Correlation), ssd (Sum Squared
  Difference), em (Expectation-Maximization).
  

* ``--mopt_sigma_diff``

  Metric option applied on Cross correlation (CC).
  The standard deviation of the Gaussian smoothing kernel to be
  applied to the update field at each iteration.
  

* ``--mopt_radius``

  Metric option applied on Cross correlation (CC).
  the radius of the squared (cubic) neighborhood at each voxel to
  be considered to compute the cross correlation.
  

* ``--mopt_smooth``

  Metric option applied on Sum Squared Difference (SSD) and
  Expectation Maximization (EM). Smoothness parameter, the
  larger the value the smoother the deformation field.
  (default 1.0 for EM, 4.0 for SSD)
  

* ``--mopt_inner_iter``

  Metric option applied on Sum Squared Difference (SSD) and
  Expectation Maximization (EM). This is number of iterations to be
  performed at each level of the multi-resolution Gauss-Seidel
  optimization algorithm (this is not the number of steps per
  Gaussian Pyramid level, that parameter must be set for the
  optimizer, not the metric). Default 5 for EM, 10 for SSD.
  

* ``--mopt_q_levels``

  Metric option applied on Expectation Maximization (EM).
  Number of quantization levels (Default: 256 for EM)
  

* ``--mopt_double_gradient``

  Metric option applied on Expectation Maximization (EM).
  if True, the gradient of the expected static image under the moving
  modality will be added to the gradient of the moving image,
  similarly, the gradient of the expected moving image under the
  static modality will be added to the gradient of the static image.
  

* ``--mopt_step_type``

  Metric option applied on Sum Squared Difference (SSD) and
  Expectation Maximization (EM). The optimization schedule to be
  used in the multi-resolution Gauss-Seidel optimization algorithm
  (not used if Demons Step is selected). Possible value:
  ('gauss_newton', 'demons'). default: 'gauss_newton' for EM,
  'demons' for SSD.
  

* ``--step_length``

  the length of the maximum displacement vector of the update
   displacement field at each iteration.
  

* ``--ss_sigma_factor``

  parameter of the scale-space smoothing kernel. For example, the
   std. dev. of the kernel will be factor*(2^i) in the isotropic case
   where i = 0, 1, ..., n_scales is the scale.
  

* ``--opt_tol``

  the optimization will stop when the estimated derivative of the
   energy profile w.r.t. time falls below this threshold.
  

* ``--inv_iter``

  the number of iterations to be performed by the displacement field
   inversion algorithm.
  

* ``--inv_tol``

  the displacement field inversion algorithm will stop iterating
   when the inversion error falls below this threshold.
  

Output Options
--------------

* ``--out_dir``

  Directory to save the transformed files (default current directory).
  

* ``--out_warped``

  Name of the warped file.
  

* ``--out_inv_static``

  Name of the file to save the static image after applying the
   inverse mapping.
  

* ``--out_field``

  Name of the file to save the diffeomorphic map.
