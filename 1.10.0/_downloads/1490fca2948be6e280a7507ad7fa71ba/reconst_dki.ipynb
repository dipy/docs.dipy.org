        "\n# Reconstruction of the diffusion signal with the kurtosis tensor model (DKI)\n\nDiffusional Kurtosis Imaging (DKI) is an expansion of the Diffusion Tensor\nImaging (DTI) model\n(see `sphx_glr_examples_built_reconstruction_reconst_dti.py`). In\naddition to the Diffusion Tensor (DT), DKI quantifies the degree to which water\ndiffusion in biological tissues is non-Gaussian using the Kurtosis Tensor (KT)\n:footcite:p:`Jensen2005`.\n\nMeasurements of non-Gaussian diffusion from DKI are of interest because they\nwere shown to provide extra information about microstructural alterations in\nboth health and disease (for a review see our\npaper :footcite:p:`NetoHenriques2021a`). Moreover, in contrast to DTI, DKI can\nprovide metrics of tissue microscopic heterogeneity that are less sensitive to\nconfounding effects in the orientation of tissue components, thus providing\nbetter characterization in general white matter configurations (including\nregions of fibers crossing, fanning, and/or dispersing) and gray matter\n:footcite:p:`NetoHenriques2015`, :footcite:p:`NetoHenriques2021a`. Although DKI\naims primarily to quantify the degree of non-Gaussian diffusion without\nestablishing concrete biophysical assumptions, DKI can also be related to\nmicrostructural models to infer specific biophysical parameters (e.g., the\ndensity of axonal fibers) - this aspect will be more closely explored in\n:ref:sphx_glr_examples_built_reconstruction_reconst_dki_micro.py. For\nadditional information on DKI and its practical implementation within DIPY,\nrefer to :footcite:p:`NetoHenriques2021a`.\n\nBelow, we introduce a concise theoretical background of DKI and demonstrate\nits fitting process using DIPY. We'll also guide you through the fitting\nprocess of DKI using DIPY, demonstrating how to effectively apply this\ntechnique. Furthermore, we discuss the various diffusion metrics that can be\nderived from DKI, providing insight into their practical significance and\napplications. Additionally, we address strategies to mitigate common artifacts,\nsuch as implausible negative kurtosis estimates, which manifest as 'black'\nvoxels or holes in DKI maps. These artifacts can compromise the accuracy of\nthe DKI analysis, and we'll offer solutions to ensure more reliable results.\n\n## Theory\n\nThe DKI model expresses the diffusion-weighted signal as:\n\n\\begin{align}S(n,b)=S_{0}e^{-bD(n)+\\frac{1}{6}b^{2}D(n)^{2}K(n)}\\end{align}\n\nwhere $\\mathbf{b}$ is the applied diffusion weighting (which is dependent on\nthe measurement parameters), $S_0$ is the signal in the absence of diffusion\ngradient sensitization, $\\mathbf{D(n)}$ is the value of diffusion along\ndirection $\\mathbf{n}$, and $\\mathbf{K(n)}$ is the value of kurtosis along\ndirection $\\mathbf{n}$. The directional diffusion $\\mathbf{D(n)}$ and kurtosis\n$\\mathbf{K(n)}$ can be related to the diffusion tensor (DT) and kurtosis tensor\n(KT) using the following equations:\n\n\\begin{align}D(n)=\\sum_{i=1}^{3}\\sum_{j=1}^{3}n_{i}n_{j}D_{ij}\\end{align}\n\nand\n\n\\begin{align}K(n)=\\frac{MD^{2}}{D(n)^{2}}\\sum_{i=1}^{3}\\sum_{j=1}^{3}\\sum_{k=1}^{3}\n     \\sum_{l=1}^{3}n_{i}n_{j}n_{k}n_{l}W_{ijkl}\\end{align}\n\nwhere $D_{ij}$ are the elements of the second-order DT, and $W_{ijkl}$ the\nelements of the fourth-order KT and $MD$ is the mean diffusivity. As the DT,\nKT has antipodal symmetry and thus only 15 Wijkl elements are needed to fully\ncharacterize the KT:\n\n\\begin{align}\\begin{matrix} ( & W_{xxxx} & W_{yyyy} & W_{zzzz} & W_{xxxy} & W_{xxxz}\n                    & ... \\\\\n                    & W_{xyyy} & W_{yyyz} & W_{xzzz} & W_{yzzz} & W_{xxyy}\n                    & ... \\\\\n                    & W_{xxzz} & W_{yyzz} & W_{xxyz} & W_{xyyz} & W_{xyzz}\n                    & & )\\end{matrix}\\end{align}\n\n## DKI fitting in DIPY\n\nIn the following example we show how to fit the diffusion kurtosis model on\ndiffusion-weighted multi-shell datasets and how to estimate diffusion kurtosis\nbased statistics.\n\nFirst, we import all relevant modules:\n"

MK is, therefore,\nhigher in white matter since it is highly compartmentalized by myelin\nsheaths. These water diffusion compartmentalization is expected to be more\npronounced perpendicularly to white matter fibers and thus the RK map\npresents higher amplitudes than the AK map.\n\n## Mitigating 'Black' Voxels / Holes in DKI metrics\n\nIt is important to note that kurtosis estimates might present implausible\nnegative estimates in deep white matter regions that will manifest as\n'Black' voxels or holes in DKI metrics (e.g. see the band of dark voxels in\nthe  RK map above). These negative kurtosis values are artifactual and might\nbe induced by:\n1) low radial diffusivities of aligned white matter - since it is very hard\nto capture non-Gaussian information in radial direction due to its low\ndiffusion decays, radial kurtosis estimates (and consequently the mean\nkurtosis estimates) might have low robustness and tendency to exhibit\nnegative values :footcite:p:`NetoHenriques2012`, :footcite:p:`Tabesh2011`;\n2) Gibbs artifacts - MRI images might be corrupted by signal oscillation\nartifact between tissue's edges if an inadequate number of high frequencies\nof the k-space is sampled. These oscillations might have different signs on\nimages acquired with different diffusion-weighted and inducing negative\nbiases in kurtosis parametric maps :footcite:p:`Perrone2015`,\n:footcite:p:`NetoHenriques2018`. 3) Underestimation of b0 signals - Due to\nphysiological or noise artifacts, the signals acquired at b-value=0 may be\nartifactually lower than the diffusion-weighted signals acquired for the\ndifferent b-values. In this case, the log diffusion-weighted signal decay may\nappear to be concave rather than showing to be convex (as one would typically\nexpect), leading to negative kurtosis value estimates.\n\nGiven the above, one can try to suppress the 'Black' voxel / holes in DKI\nmetrics by:\n1) using more advanced noise and artifact suppression algorithms, e.g.,\nas mentioned above, the MP-PCA denoising\n(`sphx_glr_examples_built_preprocessing_denoise_mppca.py`), other\ndenoising alternatives such as Patch2self\n(`sphx_glr_examples_built_preprocessing_denoise_patch2self.py`) or\nincorporating methods for Gibbs Artifact Unringing\n(`sphx_glr_examples_built_preprocessing_denoise_gibbs.py`)\nalgorithms.\n2) computing the kurtosis values from powder-averaged diffusion-weighted\nsignals which are known to be less sensitive to implausible negative\nestimates. The details on how to compute the kurtosis from powder-averaged\nsignals in DIPY are described in the following tutorial\n(`sphx_glr_examples_built_reconstruction_reconst_msdki.py`).\n3) computing alternative definitions of mean and radial kurtosis such as\nthe mean kurtosis tensor (MKT) and radial tensor kurtosis (RTK) metrics (see\nbelow).\n4) constrained optimization to ensure that the fitted parameters\nare physically plausible :footcite:p:`DelaHaije2020` (see below).\n\n## Alternative DKI metrics\n\nIn addition to the standard mean, axial, and radial kurtosis metrics shown\nabove, alternative metrics can be computed from DKI, e.g.:\n1) the mean kurtosis tensor (MKT) - defined as the trace of the kurtosis\ntensor - is a quantity that provides a contrast similar to the standard MK\nbut it is more robust to noise artifacts :footcite:p:`Hansen2013`,\n:footcite:p:`NetoHenriques2021a`. 2) the radial tensor kurtosis (RTK) provides\nan alternative definition to standard radial kurtosis (RK) that, as MKT, is\nmore robust to noise artifacts :footcite:p:`Hansen2013`.\n3) the kurtosis fractional anisotropy (KFA) that quantifies the anisotropy of\nthe kurtosis tensor :footcite:p:`Glenn2015`, which provides different\ninformation than the FA measures from the diffusion tensor.\n\nThese measures are computed and illustrated below:\n\n"
